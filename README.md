# AlarmClockTimer
Zip file contains code that, when ran, will display a timer that counts down to zero given a user-provided time input. 
Timer will print on user console/terminal and will sound an alarm when it has elapsed, upon which it prompts the user
if they wish to run the timer again, or quit the program.
